**Intro**

This webpage is the third project in the Software Engineer program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on a design spec provided using Figma. The main focus of this project was to build a responsive webpage that would seamlessly adjust its layout based on the screen size. The break points for this webpage were determined by the common screen sizes of popular electronic devices, as well as how webpage elements looked and interacted with eachother at different resolutions.

**Technologies**

The webpage was made to be responsive/adaptive using CSS flexbox and grid properties. Additionally, relative width values were given to elements so that no sizes are fixed. Media queries are included to change the layout of the webpage at specific resolutions.

**Images**

Each image was exported from Figma as either a PNG, JPEG, or SVG. The PNG and JPEG images were compressed using **_tinypng.com_**, and then stored in the `/images` folder.
